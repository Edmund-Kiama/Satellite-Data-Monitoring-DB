# the app should be able to
# - have a menu for creating, display, update, delete tables
# - for those CRUD menus, they ask for the tree tables

# for creating new values for tables - ask the user for the values

# display just displays the tables

# for updating, 
#     - the user picks which table and which value to change,
#     - then prompt user for value
#     - then update the value to db

# for deleting
#     - the user picks which table and which value to delete
#     - update the db
